You can find the filter bank in Phase1/Code/ There is a folder for each filter. In this directory there is also a png of the images of all the filters in one png. You can find the ouput in the Output folder for texton, brightness, and color map which are labeled. The gradient data is labeled tg, bg, and cg respectively.
